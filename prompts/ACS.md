Recursively search the _course_2501 folder for material information, specifically the objectives in the html files with relation to the _modules and augment them with relevant textual data from the html file objectives in the _course_2501 folder. Make sure to keep the styles of the html files in the _modules _code-alongs and _sprint-challenge make sure to read the html files as context and make a plan before proceeding to update the files in the _modules _code-alongs and _sprint-challenge folders. Make sure to elaborate on the objective information and position the textual data under each video giving code examples where appropriate. Also make sure to add leetcode problem links where appropriate in the modules. And wherever "Codesignal Arcade" is referenced put leet code problem collections for interview questions in it's place explaining that the "Codesignal Arcade" is no longer available and that the leetcode links are using the same principal and are a great alternative. Please also make sure to keep the orange color for all links in the modules and html files to keep in line with the current styles for the pages
