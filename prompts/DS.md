# Data Science Curriculum

Recursively search the _course_2273 folder for material information, specifically the objectives in the html files with relation to the _modules and augment them with relevant textual data from the html file objectives in the _course_2273 folder.

Make sure to:

1. Keep the dark-themed styling consistent with the existing site design
   - Use dark backgrounds: #1a1d23 (main), #222831 (container), #2a303c (sections)
   - Use light text: white (#ffffff) for primary text, #b3b3b3 for secondary text
   - Use orange accent colors: #ff5722 for primary accent, #ff7043 for hover states
   - Follow the existing box-shadow and border styling in the dark theme

2. Maintain the structure and styles of the html files in the _modules, _code-alongs, _INDEX and _sprint-challenge through use of the styles in the _CSS file.

3. Elaborate on the objective information and position the textual data under each video, giving code examples where appropriate.

4. Ensure all links with target="_blank" also include rel="noopener" for security purposes.

5. Keep the orange color (#ff5722) for all links in the modules and HTML files to maintain consistency with the current styles.

6. Do not use inline styling. Always use reusable classes defined in the _CSS file.

7. Inside any <pre> or <code> tags, make sure to use "&lt;" and "&gt;" to escape the "<" and ">" characters.

Make sure to read the html files as context and make a plan before proceeding to update the files in the _modules, _code-alongs and _sprint-challenge folders and _INDEX.
