                <h2>Module Overview</h2>
                <p>This final module explores Time Series Forecasting, a specialized application of machine learning that deals with data points indexed in chronological order. Time series data is unique because the temporal ordering of observations is critical and often contains patterns like trends, seasonality, and cycles that can be leveraged for prediction.</p>
                
                <p>Building on the LSTM networks covered in Module 1, you'll learn how to adapt these powerful recurrent neural networks specifically for time series problems. By the end of this module, you'll understand how to preprocess temporal data, structure LSTM models for forecasting, and evaluate their performanceâ€”skills that are highly valuable across industries from finance and economics to energy and healthcare.</p>
