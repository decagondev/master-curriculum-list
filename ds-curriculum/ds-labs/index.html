                    Team Standups are how you stay in sync with your team. Every weekday at the start of your Labs time
                    slot, you'll have the opportunity to meet live with your team for 30 minutes to go over your standup
                    updates. Standup updates can be submitted asynchronously if you can't attend live.
                </li>

                    insights into learning your core competencies and are delivered seven days a week in the morning,
                    afternoon, and evening. Because Workshops often delve deeper into a core competency, you will need
                    to come to class prepared to have the best experience. Workshops are recorded if you can't attend
                    live.

                <h2>Engagement Expectations</h2>
                <p>Attendance and participation in BloomTech courses are measured in multiple ways, including but not
                    limited to taking attendance in live instruction experiences, verifying module & sprint project
                    attempts, and confirming activity in BloomTech's Learning Management Systems.</p>
                <p>While learners may choose to attend live or view recorded sessions, attendance and engagement with
                    the material are critical to success in the program. Learners who do not have activity on the
                    Learning Management Systems for more than seven (7) days will be flagged as inactive, and BloomTech
                    will reach out to verify enrollment.</p>
                <p>While in Labs, you'll need to remain engaged and make progress on your project work. You'll need
                    to:<br>
                    Login to the Portal and work on your Labs project.</p>
                <p>BloomTech may withdraw inactive learners to protect them from unintentional further vesting of
                    tuition.</p>
                <p>Learners who are unable to engage with the curriculum and make satisfactory progress due to
                    extenuating circumstances may need to take a leave of absence.</p>
