                <h2>Engagement Expectations</h2>
                <p>Attendance and participation in BloomTech courses are measured in multiple ways, including but not
                    limited to verifying module & sprint project
                    attempts, and confirming activity in BloomTech's Learning Management Systems.</p>
                <p>Attendance and engagement with
                    the material are critical to success in the program. Learners who do not have activity on the
                    Learning Management Systems for more than seven (7) days will be flagged as inactive, and BloomTech
                    will reach out to verify enrollment.</p>
                <p>While in Labs, you'll need to remain engaged and make progress on your project work. You'll need
                    to:<br>
                    Login to the Portal and work on your Labs project.</p>
                <p>BloomTech may withdraw inactive learners to protect them from unintentional further vesting of
                    tuition.</p>
                <p>Learners who are unable to engage with the curriculum and make satisfactory progress due to
                    extenuating circumstances may need to take a leave of absence.</p>
