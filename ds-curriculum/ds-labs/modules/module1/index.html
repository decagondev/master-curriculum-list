            <h2>Welcome to Labs</h2>
            <p>Excited to have you join us in Labs! ðŸŽ‰</p>
            <p>
                Labs is the perfect opportunity for you to put your knowledge and skills to the test. This course is
                designed to help you integrate everything you've learned into a complex project, allowing you to build
                and articulate your code contributions with confidence. You'll be ready to ace technical interviews and
                start your career as a successful software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get ready to work on challenging projects and components during our five-module structure. After
                completing onboarding, you'll move on to three build sprints that will give you the chance to practice
                and hone your skills in a low-stress environment. Our goal is to provide you with a platform to apply
                your skills and communicate your contributions effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only will you have the chance to demonstrate your technical skills on a complex project, but you'll
                also learn about agile, kanban, and kanban software. Labs will simulate junior dev workflow, giving you
                a taste of what to expect on your first job.
            </p>
            <p>
                This course lays out everything you'll need to get up and running in Labs, start making contributions to
                your product, and set off on your path toward graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's go! ðŸš€

            <h2>How Labs Works</h2>
            <p>The goal of Labs is to help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply and integrate skills taught in core on a complex project.</li>
                <li>Articulate code contributions confidently in a technical interview.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To achieve this, we will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Present you with a project template.</strong> This template will give you starter code for
                    you to build off
                    of. You will fork this GitHub template, locally setup the repo on your computer, and begin work on
                    tickets we've made for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Give you tickets to add components/features to the existing project.</strong> Similar to
                    what a junior dev
                    might do, you will add working code to the complex project and deliver the requirements of each
                    ticket.</li>
                <li><strong>Have you submit your code alongside a Loom video explaining what you did and why you did
                        it.</strong> Each
                    build sprint will require the submission of 2 deliverables: loom video link and GitHub code link.
                    The code is meant to test your technical ability, and the loom video is meant to simulate a
                    technical interview.</li>
                <li><strong>Grade your deliverables based on the rubric attached to each sprint submission.</strong> The
                    rubric will
                    measure if you are ready for your first dev job based on your ability to code and how well you
                    articulate what you did.</li>
                <li><strong>Check your resume for your Labs' contributions.</strong> We want to make sure that you added
                    the complex
                    project you worked on to your resume to showcase your ability as an developer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To give this plan structure, we have divided these goals into 5 modules:</p>

        <section class="content-box">
            <h2>Labs Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the Labs environment, it's important to understand the technology stack that powers
                it. In software development, a technology stack refers to the combination of tools, frameworks, and
                languages used to build a product.</p>
            <p>The following is a list of the key components in the Labs Tech Stack:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> FastAPI - modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs
                    with Python 3.7+</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB - flexible document-based db that map directly to objects in your
                    code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By being familiar with these technologies, you'll be better equipped to complete Labs modules and build
                your coding skills.</p>

        <section class="content-box">
            <h2>Getting Support</h2>
            <p>In Labs, you'll have a fleet of staff, instructors, learner assistants, and career reviewers to support
                you. Here's how to get help.</p>

            <h3>The 20-Minute Rule</h3>
            <p>For technical problems, follow the 20-minute rule:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, try to solve the problem on your own for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>If still unsolved, loop in a teammate for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>If still unsolved, loop in your team's Learning Assistant for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>If still unsolved, post in the Labs Slack channel.</li>
                <li>If still unsolved, post in the Hub Knowledge Base for support from your community of peers and
                    instructors!</li>
                <li>If still unsolved, open a support ticket in the Hub for help from a Learning Assistant.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Please do not send Slack DMs to your instructors! Instead, you can always use the
                Knowledge Base or open a support ticket in the Hub. This helps make sure you get the quickest support
                possible!</p>

            <h3>Nontechnical Issues</h3>
            <p>For nontechnical concerns (like an issue with a teammate), open a support ticket in The Hub. This helps
                make sure your concern is routed to the right place. (If it's an emergency, that's the once case in
                which you should escalate it to a Labs staff member immediately!)</p>

        <section class="content-box">
            <h2>Project Setup</h2>
            <p>Learn how to set up your local development environment and get familiar with the project structure.</p>

            <h3>Local Setup</h3>
            <p>Now you're ready to get set up with your project! ðŸš€</p>
            <p>For this final step, you'll fork your project's repositories, clone the forked version from GitHub, and
                set up your environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Note: You must fork the starter repo to your personal GitHub account before starting
                    local setup.</strong></p>

            <h3>20-Minute Rule</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions, bugs, or concerns while setting up, follow the 20-minute rule:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>First try searching on your own for a solutionâ€”search Google, Stack Overflow, and the documentation
                    for the component you're struggling with (like the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python docs</a>). Start
                    flexing this muscle now!</li>
                <li>If you're stuck after 20 minutes, post in your team's Slack channel.</li>
                <li>If you're still stuck, post in your Labs Slack channel.</li>
                <li>If you're still stuck, post in the Hub Knowledge Base.</li>
                <li>If you're still stuck, open a support ticket in the Hub!</li>
