<p><span>Continue to use TensorFlow Keras and a sample of the Quickdraw dataset to build a sketch classification model. The dataset has been sampled to only 10 classes and 10000 observations per class. Next, apply regularization techniques to your model.</span></p>
<p><span>Don't forget to switch to GPU on Colab!</span></p>
<h3 id="regularization">Regularization</h3>
<p><span>Using your best performing model from the previous module, apply each of the following regularization strategies:</span></p>
<p>Early Stopping<br>Dropout<br>Weight Decay<br>Weight Constraint</p>
