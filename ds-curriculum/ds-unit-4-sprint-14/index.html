                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>Welcome to DS Unit 4 Sprint 14, focused on Neural Networks. Neural networks form the foundation of modern deep learning approaches and have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Throughout this sprint, you'll learn the entire neural network lifecycle: from designing architectures to training efficient models, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance, and deploying models in production environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Neural networks excel at handling complex patterns in data that traditional machine learning algorithms struggle with. They've achieved remarkable success in computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting, and many other domains. By understanding how to build and deploy neural networks, you'll gain valuable skills that are highly sought after in the data science job market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each module in this sprint builds on the previous ones, guiding you through a logical progression from theory to practical implementation to deployment. By the end of this sprint, you'll be able to create, train, and deploy neural networks for real-world applications.</p>
