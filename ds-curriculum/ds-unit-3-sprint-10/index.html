            <h2>Welcome to Sprint 10!</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>What does "data" look like? If you try to picture it, you probably see rows and columns - a spreadsheet or CSV, that can be easily loaded with <code>pandas</code> , cleaned, and analyzed. As a data scientist, this will often be the form you want your data to be in - but it's probably not how your data started.</p>
                
                <p>Most modern data is generated automatically by human interaction with a web-backed application - every action they take, every click they make, all travels over a network and is saved by the server. Though in the rawest of forms this may be a log file, in most cases where it really goes is a database.</p>
                
                <p>So, what is a database? A place for data! If it's relational, it's actually still pretty close to that rows and columns picture, though with some important additional functionality. These databases are commonly accessed using SQL - Structured Query Language - a standard based on relational algebra, and a useful tool known not just by data scientists but by software engineers, MBAs, and more.</p>
                
                <p>If it's so-called "NoSQL", then it's most likely a document-oriented database (or document store) - which, despite the glamor, is essentially a bunch of key-value pairs. What key-value pair object are you already familiar with? Python dicts!</p>
                
                <p>In this sprint, we will learn about both of the above paradigms, and how the separation between them is not as bright a line as you may think.</p>

            <h2>Sprint Modules</h2>
            
            <div class="module-card">
                <h3>Module 1: Introduction to SQL</h3>
                <p>Structured Query Language - the Lingua Franca of Data. Known (to varying degrees) by software engineers, data scientists, DevOps, and MBAs, SQL is the beginning (and sometimes entirety) of many data pipelines. Why is it universal? One reason is it is relatively simple - it is a declarative language, demanding what it wants by mere description, not worrying about the details of "how." SQL is a standard - all SQL distributions support a common core of functionality, and most add their own features or special syntax on top of it. For our purposes, we will focus on PostgreSQL, but most of what we learn will be general.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="module-card">
                <h3>Module 2: SQL for Analysis</h3>
                <p>SQL is simple, but can still be surprisingly powerful - as we learned in the first unit, a lot of analysis can be done with just descriptive statistics, and with the right query SQL can do all that and more.</p>
                <div class="resource-links">
                    <a href="modules/module2/index.html" class="resource-link secondary">View Module</a>

            <div class="module-card">
                <h3>Module 3: NoSQL and Document-Oriented Databases</h3>
                <p>Need to deal with Big Data? You may need tools beyond standard SQL approaches. Enter NoSQL and document-oriented databases!</p>
                <p>These systems favor flexibility and horizontal scaling, using JSON-like document models that feel familiar if you've used Python dictionaries.</p>

                <h3>Module 4: ACID and Database Scalability Trade-offs</h3>
                <p>SQL or NoSQL? Why not both!</p>
                <p>Picking the right database for a situation can be a tricky problem, with many tradeoffs. SQL gives us ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees and powerful analytical queries, and NoSQL gives us huge scale and usually "good enough" guarantees. But innovation is happening all the time, with NewSQL proposing to give us the best of both worlds.</p>
