            <h3>What is a Code-Along?</h3>
            <p>Code-Alongs are live experiences taught by our expert instructors designed to prepare you for concepts found in the sprint challenges. Code-Alongs are your opportunity to work on complex job-ready problems in a live and engaging environment.</p>
            
            <p>Code-Alongs are live classes 50 minutes in length designed to offer deeper insights into learning your core competencies and are offered seven days a week in the morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>
            
            <p>Because Code-Alongs delve deeper into a core competency, you will need to come to class prepared to have the best experience.</p>
