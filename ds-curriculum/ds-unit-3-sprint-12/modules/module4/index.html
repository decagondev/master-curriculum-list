                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the importance of informational interviews in your job search</li>

            <h2>Objective 1: Informational Interviews</h2>
            <div class="content-box">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Informational interviews or coffee chats as we often refer to them here at BloomTech are informal conversations you have with professionals in your field of interest. The primary purpose is to gather information about a career field, industry, or company rather than to secure a job.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike job interviews, informational interviews are initiated by the job seeker and focus on learning rather than being evaluated for a position. While not the primary purpose, job opportunities can come out of these types of conversations and are often a very effective method for networking that can lead to referrals or introductions to others that are hiring. <i>Worst case scenario you learn from someone working in the industry and get some great advice!</i></p>
                
                <p>Benefits of Informational Interviews:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Networking Opportunities</strong>: Informational interviews allow you to expand your professional network by building relationships with industry insiders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gaining Industry Insights</strong>: They provide firsthand insights into the realities of working in a specific field or company, beyond what you can find online.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identifying Career Paths and Job Roles</strong>: Through these conversations, you can learn about different career paths and job roles that you may not have considered before.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developing Professional Relationships</strong>: Building a rapport with professionals can lead to future opportunities, mentorship, and advice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job Opportunities</strong>: Informational Interviews can produce referrals for roles or introductions to hiring managers/team members and lead to interviews.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Informational Interviews are often a longer term strategy to finding a job so that's why it's important to get started with them NOW. Building relationships with people in the tech industry before you graduate will give you more support during your job search after graduation. You may be reaching out to someone at a company that isn't currently hiring BUT these types of conversations can keep you top of mind when they do have a role open up that aligns with your skillset.</p>
