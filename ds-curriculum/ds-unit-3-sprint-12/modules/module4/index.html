            <h2>Informational Interviews</h2>
                <h3>Who to target for informational interviews</h3>
                <p>To get started with informational interviews, create a list of 5-10 companies you're interested in working for. For each company, use LinkedIn to find potential interviewees. You'll see the highest response rate when targeting those with whom you have something in common or whose background interests you.</p>
                <p>Target people who:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Have a background similar to yours:</strong> BloomTech graduates, coding bootcamp alumni, same alma mater, former colleagues, or similar interests</li>
                    <li><strong>Have a background you find interesting:</strong> People in roles you'd love to have in 5-10 years, those with interesting career paths, career transitioners, or those who started in tech-adjacent roles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember to tailor your messages to highlight commonalities or specific aspects of their background that interest you.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h3>How to Connect With Potential Interviewees</h3>
                <p>Use email finders like Clearbit, Skrapp.io, or Hunter.io to contact people on your list. Include an "ask" for a call to discuss their role and background, and make scheduling easy by including your Calendly link.</p>
                <p><strong>Example subject lines:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seeking Your Insights on the Tech Industry: Informational Interview Request</li>
                    <li>Learning from the Best: Can We Chat About Your Journey into Tech?</li>
                    <li>Aspiring [Job Title] Looking for Your Guidance</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Email templates include:</strong> personalized outreach for people with similar backgrounds, those with interesting backgrounds you'd like to learn about, and follow-up messages if you don't hear back within 2-3 days.</p>

                <h3>How to Prepare for an Informational Interview</h3>
                <p>You have two main goals: meet someone new and drive the conversation toward future opportunities. Before your meeting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review their LinkedIn profile and note commonalities and key background points</li>
                    <li>Prepare questions to lead the conversation about their career journey, industry insights, and advice</li>
                    <li>Ask about their transition into tech, key career decisions, industry evolution, and staying updated with trends</li>
                    <li>Drive toward opportunity discussions: "Once I graduate, what advice do you have for standing out in the application process?"</li>
                    <li>Ask for referrals: "Is there anyone else within the company or your network you'd recommend I speak to?"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Informational Interview Follow-up</h3>
                <p>Complete these steps to maintain relationships and keep doors open:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Send a thank you email:</strong> Reference specific takeaways from your conversation and express appreciation for their time and any offers for future referrals</li>
                    <li><strong>Set calendar reminders:</strong> Follow up in 1-2 months with relevant articles, project updates, or offers to help them with anything</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keeping connections alive is as important as making new ones - you never know what being top of mind can do for your future!</p>

            <h2>Building Your Resume</h2>
                <p>Continue building your resume by adding new technical skills and projects from your recent sprints, and learn to effectively tailor your resume to specific job descriptions.</p>
                
                <h3>Skills & Projects</h3>
                <p>A technical skills section allows readers to quickly scan your tech stack and helps Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) catch key technical skills. The projects section showcases your practical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
                <p>Key strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Continually update with your most recent work - aim for 2-3 quality projects by program completion</li>
                    <li>Include Guided Projects and Sprint Challenges from your coursework</li>
                    <li>Use the format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]"</li>
                    <li>Consider starting a side project NOW to stand out - it can be listed as "In Progress"</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/2qqfft28qp" title="Skills & Projects" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Tailoring your Resume</h3>
                <p>Customize your resume to match specific job requirements and preferences. This demonstrates you're a strong fit and helps with both hiring managers and ATS systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Steps to tailor effectively:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Analyze the Job Description:</strong> Extract keywords and understand main responsibilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Match Your Experience:</strong> Include positions and projects that align with the job description</li>
                    <li><strong>Update Content:</strong> Match headline to role title, rewrite bullet points using job description verbiage, add relevant technical skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Review and Refine:</strong> Proofread, quantify achievements, and get feedback</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep your resume as a Google Doc and create a new copy for each role application (File > Make a Copy > Role Title_Firstname Lastname).</p>

            <h2>Finding Jobs</h2>
                <h3>Example Job Titles Based on Your Skills so Far</h3>
                <p>Your expanding skill set qualifies you for various tech and tech-adjacent roles. These can be full-time or part-time positions, and part-time roles can provide income while building experience during the program.</p>
                <p><strong>Potential Job Titles:</strong></p>
                <p>Data Entry Specialist, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Customer Support, Data Strategist, Customer Support and Success Associate, Data Analyst Intern, Big Data Support, AI Prompt Engineer, Data Analyst, Junior Data Engineer, Junior Data Scientist, Junior Data Analyst, Associate Solutions Architect, Analytics Consultant, Data Ops</p>
                <p>Leverage your pre-BloomTech skills - they help separate you from other candidates. For example, customer service experience makes you a stronger candidate for Customer Support roles.</p>

                <h3>Job Search Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set filters to "Date Posted = last 24 hours or last week" for fresh opportunities</li>
                    <li>Apply if you meet at least 50% of job requirements (aim for 0-3 years experience)</li>
                    <li>Apply directly on company websites, not through easy-apply portals</li>
                    <li>Skip cover letters unless explicitly required; focus on networking outreach instead</li>
                    <li>For salary questions, list "market rate for [role] in [location]" or "negotiable"</li>
                </ul>
