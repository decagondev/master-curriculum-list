<title>Assignment: Attempt Official GCA Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<h4><strong>The GCA Requirement for this Sprint</strong></h4>
<p><span>It is time to attempt the </span><strong>official General Code Assessment (GCA) test!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Attempting this test is a requirement to pass this sprint</strong><span>.&nbsp; You will attempt this test multiple times throughout the program.&nbsp; This is so that you can determine areas that you may need to study more to earn a higher score.&nbsp; Keep in mind that only your highest score is tracked in the BloomTech database, no matter how many times you take the test.</span></p>
<p><span>While in this sprint, you are not required to achieve a specific score, the target you should <strong>aim to achieve is 295 or higher</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The score requirement becomes effective later in the program when you start the Applied Computer Science unit (more information will be shared when you start this unit).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But there is no need to wait - you can study, practice, and prepare now to achieve a score of 295 or higher!</span></p>

<h4><strong>How to Prepare:</strong></h4>

</ol>
<p>You should have already created your CodeSignal account*, if you have not done so, please reference: <a title="What is CodeSignal and How to Create Your Account" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/g204d4e71e2e17c3ce81c90bd5fbdf1c6" data-api-endpoint="https://bloomtech.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2198/pages/what-is-codesignal-and-how-to-create-your-account" data-api-returntype="Page">What is CodeSignal and How to Create Your Account</a>, <a title="CodeSignal User Interface Overview" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/g369c14a7da165c40062023440e6f6b3e" data-api-endpoint="https://bloomtech.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2198/pages/codesignal-user-interface-overview" data-api-returntype="Page">CodeSignal User Interface Overview</a> and <a title="Introduction to GCA" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/ge6d02782045216f2d108be9f7f168fb2" data-api-endpoint="https://bloomtech.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2198/pages/introduction-to-gca" data-api-returntype="Page">Introduction to GCA</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>*<strong>As a reminder,</strong> you must create your CodeSignal account using the SAME email address you use to login to the learning portal. Failure to do so will mean that your GCA test scores will not sync to the BloomTech database.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i data-stringify-type="italic">What happens if the email I use to log in to CodeSignal to take the General Code Assessment (GCA) test is different than the email I use to log in to the Portal?</i></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"><strong>If the email logins don't match</strong>, your GCA test results will not be tracked in the BloomTech database, and you will have to <strong>retake the GCA using your matched login credentials</strong>.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>
<p><span>A score of 295 can be achieved by getting 100% on tests and passing any task. Task #1 is generally the easiest.&nbsp; If you don't achieve the required score on this attempt, don't worry as you will get more chances to retake this assessment throughout the program.&nbsp; Remember that there is a 2-week cool-off period before you can attempt the GCA again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Remember that the problems are intended not to have obvious solutions</strong>; hence you won't see a path to complete a problem immediately. It might take a while to understand the problem and develop a plan before you can begin coding. Don't rush into coding!</span></p>
