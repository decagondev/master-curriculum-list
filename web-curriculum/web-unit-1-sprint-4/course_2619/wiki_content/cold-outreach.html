    <p>Cold outreach is outreach targeted at individuals you have no connection with. You can be strategic in who you target by finding people you have something in common with or whose career paths you are interested in. This can help make the emails more inviting to the recipient. For example, you can target graduates of other boot camps! While they aren’t in your network you already have something in common, a non-traditional path into the tech industry.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> Write your outreach message. Below are a couple of templates to help you get started. Please keep in mind these are examples and you should rewrite to fit your specific situation.</span></p>
