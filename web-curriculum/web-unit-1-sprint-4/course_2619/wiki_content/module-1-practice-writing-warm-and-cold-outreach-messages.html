<p><span>Networking is the most successful way of finding a meaningful job and attaining career success.&nbsp; In fact, did you know that 80% of open positions are filled through networking?&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>You now have an opportunity to practice what you learned in this module!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you improve your networking and outreach skills, in this practice activity, you will write a warm and cold outreach message.</span></p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<p><span>1. In your personal Google drive or on your desktop, create two new folders one for Warm Outreach and one for Cold Outreach. This is where you will save your outreach messages</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; <strong>Prepare 1 warm outreach message.</strong>&nbsp; Your warm network are individuals whom you already know. They could be alumni, past colleagues, former managers, or friends. Follow the best practice tips that you learned from the <a title="Write an effective warm outreach message" href="$WIKI_REFERENCE$/pages/g94ea482090fda2f64e56e86c2f6ccb8b" data-api-endpoint="https://bloomtech.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2198/pages/write-an-effective-warm-outreach-message" data-api-returntype="Page">video lesson</a>.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Make a list of 5 individuals in your network.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Out of this list, <strong>select 1 individual </strong>that you would want to reach out to first</span></li>
<li><span>Create a new Google Doc and draft 1 outreach message to this selected individual.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>3. <strong>Prepare 1 cold outreach message.</strong>&nbsp; Your cold network are individuals that you do not know. They could be LinkedIn contacts or a referral through someone you know.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Identify 1 individual </strong>that you do not know and would like to reach out to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Draft 1 “cold” outreach message to the selected individual in a Google doc.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>For this activity, you only have to practice writing 1 warm and 1 cold outreach. The intent of this is to help you get started!&nbsp; As you learned in this module, it is important to make a plan on how you will continue with your networking and outreach ...as this should be an ongoing activity!</p>
