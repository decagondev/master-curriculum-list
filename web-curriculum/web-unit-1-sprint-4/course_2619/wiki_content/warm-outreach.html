    <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rbl">
    <p>Warm outreach is outreach targeted at those already within your network. It doesn’t have to be someone you speak to every day or even that you know personally. You can also target those you have a loose connection with like other BloomTech alumni. You both have similar interests/backgrounds you can mention in your messaging that help make the outreach warm.</p>
    <p><span>Writing this type of outreach can take time because you do want to personalize it to the specific person and to your specific situation. To get started let’s practice together.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><span> Think of someone that is currently in your network. Maybe a relative who works in the tech industry or a previous co-worker who recently made the switch to the tech field. Not everyone may have someone come to mind that fits these descriptions. If that is the case you can use BloomTech’s LinkedIn page to target an alumni.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> Write your outreach message. Below are a couple of templates to help you get started. Please keep in mind these are examples and you should rewrite them to fit your specific situation.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><strong>An email for a BloomTech Alumni</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>Subject: Connect?</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong><span>Hi NAME, </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>I recently started at BloomTech, I’m finishing up unit 1 right now! I’ve been trying to connect with alumni to learn a bit more about their path into the tech industry and came across your profile while doing a little research. I’m intrigued by your career path. Junior Developer to Senior Engineer is quite an accomplishment - congrats on your new role by the way! [Insert something personal to them here. What I’ve included is an example].</span></p>
    <p><span>Right now I’m just looking for advice on what I can do to set myself apart in the market when I start job searching. Would you be willing to connect for a 20-minute call so I could ask you a few questions? I’d love to hear a bit more about your experience working at COMPANY NAME. Please feel free to grab a time that works for you on my Calendly: INSERT LINK.</span><span><br></span></p>
    <p><span>I look forward to speaking with you soon!</span></p>

    <h4><strong>An email for a contact within your network</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>Subject: Checking In</strong></p>
    <p><span>NAME - Hello!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I hope you’ve been doing well, I know it’s been a while since we’ve last spoken. Sad to have missed you at the high school reunion last year [Insert something personal to them here. What I’ve included is an example]!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I’m reaching out to let you know that I’ve decided to pursue a career in the tech industry. I’m currently completing the PROGRAM NAME at BloomTech, an online coding boot camp. Right now I’m seeking advice from anyone who works in the field as I know transitioning industries is never easy and want to set myself up for success. My question for you is do you happen to know anyone that works in tech that might be beneficial for me to connect with?&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Specifically, I'm interested in learning more about different roles within the tech industry, gaining insights into the day-to-day responsibilities of tech professionals, and understanding the skills and experiences that are valued most in the field.</span></p>
    <p><span>I appreciate any help you can provide and will continue to stay in touch as I continue this journey!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Best,&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>NAME</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong><span> If you don’t already have a Calendly it can make scheduling calls like these very simple. Here's how to create a free account:</span></p>
    <p><i></i></p>
    <ul>
        <li aria-level="1"><i><span>Set up your Calendly account here: </span></i><a href="https://calendly.com/app/signup"><i><span>https://calendly.com/app/signup</span></i></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><i></i><i></i></p>
    <ul>
        <li aria-level="1"><i><span>Link to your calendar and set appropriate availability based on their schedule. Here’s a </span></i><a href="https://bloomtech-1.wistia.com/medias/xi7f39ea6p">video walkthrough</a><i><span>to help you get started!</span></i></li>
    </ul>
    <p><i></i><br><strong>Step 3:</strong><span> Find your contact's email address. If this is a personal connection you most likely already have a way to contact them. If you are reaching out to a BloomTech alumni you will need to track this information down. You can try to connect on LinkedIn or see if they are active in the BloomTech Alumni Group. If not, you can find their emails by using free email finders such as </span><a href="https://clearbit.com/resources/tools/connect"><span>Clearbit</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://hunter.io/"><span>Hunter.io</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://skrapp.io/"><span>Skrapp.io</span></a><span>.</span></p>
