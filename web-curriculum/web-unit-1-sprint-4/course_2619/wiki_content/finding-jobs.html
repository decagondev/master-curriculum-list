<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
</div>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-rtl">
<p><span>You are so close to the end of your first career readiness module at BloomTech and now it’s time to see WHY you are putting in all this hard work. You have completed 4 sprints and already in that time, you have built skills that make you qualified for roles within tech! </span><span>Now, these might not be the flashy titles you originally had in mind, like Software Developer or Data Scientist. But don’t worry - you’ll get there!</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, we will be exploring tech-adjacent roles that align with the tech skills you’ve learned but will also be using some of the soft or transferable skills you’ve gained from pre-BloomTech experiences. The best part - you can apply for these roles TODAY. </span><span>It's not just about snagging some income – it's about gaining valuable experience that'll make you more marketable as you get closer to graduation.</span></p>
<p><span>Securing these positions requires dedication and effort</span><span> so let's dive into some networking, and start sending off those applications and outreaches. Who knows what incredible opportunities await?</span></p>
