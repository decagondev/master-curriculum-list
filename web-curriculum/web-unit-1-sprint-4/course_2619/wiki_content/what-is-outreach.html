    <p>In the context of networking, outreach refers to the proactive efforts made by individuals or organizations to connect with and engage others within their professional or social circles.</p>
    <p><span>Outreach involves reaching out to potential contacts, peers, mentors, clients, or collaborators to build relationships, share information, find available opportunities, and build your network. Most often outreach is done by sending personalized emails, messages, or calls to introduce oneself, express interest in collaboration or mentorship, or initiate a conversation on a relevant topic.</span></p>
    <p><span>Outreach for what you will be doing here at BloomTech will often be done via email. There are two main types of outreach including:</span></p>
    <p><strong>Warm Outreach:</strong><span> Personalized messages to those already within your network or with whom you have a mutual connection. This includes former coworkers, family, friends, alumni, or other boot camp grads.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><strong>Cold Outreach:</strong><span> Personalized messages to those you have never met and have no mutual connections with.&nbsp; It could be an employee at a company where you want to work, it could be a connection on LinkedIn that is in the industry you desire to get into or it could be a hiring manager for a role youâ€™re interested in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>How you reach out to these connections varies depending on your relationship with them so next we will be working together to write your first warm and cold outreach.</span></p>
