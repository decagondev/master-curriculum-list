    <p><span>Discovering networking opportunities is key to expanding your professional circle and finding potential job opportunities. We'll equip you with strategies to proactively seek out networking events, leverage online communities, and cultivate meaningful connections.</span></p>
    <p><span>As you’ve just learned there are several different ways and outlets to network. In this section, we are going to explore a few of these in further detail and give you actionable steps to find networking opportunities that are a good fit for you!</span></p>
    <h4><strong>Professional Associations</strong></h4>
    <p><span>Below are some technology and engineering professional organizations. These associations can be valuable resources for you to learn about current trends and topics, upcoming conferences and events, networking/job opportunities, and more. While these can be great opportunities to get involved and to network this is not a necessity to be successful in the job search.&nbsp; Many have a high membership cost associated with joining but we want you to be aware that these types of organizations exist.</span></p>

    <h4><strong>Online Communities and Forums</strong></h4>
    <p><span>There are a ton of online communities and forums that you can become a member of at the click of a button. As mentioned in the previous learning objective these communities include Stack Overflow for developers, Reddit communities, Slack communities, Discord groups and so much more. Finding these is as easy as doing a quick Google search for the types of communities you are looking for. Try out some of these search terms on Google:</span></p>
    <p><span>“Discord communities for Full Stack Software Engineers”</span></p>
    <p><span>“Slack communities for boot camp graduates”</span></p>
    <p><span>“Slack communities for software engineers in [insert location]”</span></p>
    <p><span>You can also check out this running list of Slack Communities by BloomTech program: <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZgGu7nchehCqCl8R_PkUCKLUzpsGtAbmvgAKWXY8kKk/edit#heading=h.sxp47hplkwhr" target="_blank">Running List of Slack Groups</a></span></p>
    <p><span>Some of these communities will have a small application for you to fill out but most are approved quickly! Once in, be sure to search for and join any channels associated with the job search. Common names include Job Search, Job Board, Jobs, etc.</span></p>
    <h4><strong>In-Person &amp; Virtual Networking Events</strong></h4>
    <p><span>More often than not when you are looking for networking opportunities you will be targeting in-person and virtual networking opportunities like tech meet-ups (whether formal or informal), Career Fairs, and relevant conferences. Some of these are going to be more formal events where you need to dress professionally, prepare your elevator pitch, and bring copies of your resume. While others will be more informal such as a casual meetup of tech professionals at your local coffee shop. Regardless, both are great ways to find and explore potential opportunities or at the very least build invaluable relationships.</span></p>
    <p><span>At this point in your journey, we would suggest targeting more informal meetups to begin building your network. As you get closer to being ready to fully job search you’ll become more and more prepared to attend formal in-person events. If you find an event you would love to attend but need some help preparing email <a href="mailto:support@bloomtech.com">support@bloomtech.com</a> to get connected to the job search team.</span></p>

    </ul>
    <div id="topic-1">
        <p>The easiest way to find and search for events happening virtually or in your area is by using <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">https://www.eventbrite.com/</a> and <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">https://www.meetup.com/</a>. To get started please pull up both of these websites. For our purposes, you do not yet need to create an account or profile. You will merely be using these to search.</p>
        <p><span>Now that you have Eventbrite and Meetup pulled up it’s time to try out some search terms specific to you to find events.</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: We suggest starting with a vague term to start like “Tech” to see what kind of events pop up. You can filter for online events but if you would prefer something in-person be sure to type in your location and set the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the events that feel relevant to you to learn more. Most events are free but you may see a few paid throughout.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select an event that interests you.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><em><strong>You do not have to register or attend an event at this time. We just want you to understand how to find these events.</strong></em></p>
