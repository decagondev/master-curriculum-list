<p>We'll begin by breaking down the concept of networking. What exactly is networking, and why is it essential in the tech industry? We'll explore how networking goes beyond mere socializing to encompass building authentic relationships that can lead to amazing opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand not just how to network but what networking is and why it’s important. Networking involves actively engaging with others, whether in person or online, to build rapport, share information, and create opportunities for professional growth and development.</p>
<p>It goes beyond mere socializing and encompasses activities such as attending industry events, joining professional organizations, participating in online communities, and building connections with family, peers, mentors, clients, and industry leaders.</p>
<p>Throughout your time at BloomTech and as you enter the job search we will mention networking often and provide you with resources to successfully build your network and continually make new connections.</p>
