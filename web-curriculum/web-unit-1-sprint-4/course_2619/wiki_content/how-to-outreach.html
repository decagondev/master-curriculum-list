<p>In your last core competency, we covered networking in all of its forms. There are a lot of ways to network and at times can feel overwhelming. Here at BloomTech, we want to make sure you feel equipped to build your network. Throughout this core competency, we will guide you step-by-step to begin doing just that through a method called outreach.</p>
<p>Outreach is used to open doors to networking activities we mentioned previously including informational interviews or coffee chats. These types of conversations can help you learn from others already working in the field, allow you to ask for advice, ultimately open doors for future opportunities, and at the very least build your network.</p>
<p>Take your time as you navigate through the rest of this module. By the end of this core competency, you will be able to start writing warm and cold outreach messages to begin building your network - today! And remember the job search takes time so the more you connect with people now the easier and faster your job search will be later.</p>
