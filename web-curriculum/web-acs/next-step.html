            <h2>Congratulations on progressing to Labs!</h2>
            <p>We know you've worked hard to reach this milestone. Labs will be an exciting journey where you take your hard-earned knowledge and apply it to real-world environments.</p>
            
            <hr class="divider">
            
            <h2>What to Expect in Labs</h2>
            <p>Labs is an exciting hands-on experiential learning opportunity. Why does this matter to you?</p>
            <p>Well, for one, you'll be moving away from simply building projects for your portfolio to solving real-world complex and open-ended problems. With this new real-world experience, you'll be even better equipped to pitch your experience in interviews. By the time you graduate from Labs, you will have acquired new skills necessary to succeed on the job.</p>
            <p>One of the first tasks you will complete is the <strong>Labs Application</strong>. It is a brief survey that helps us place you on a team in Labs. As part of the Labs Application, you'll choose a time slot for your experience in Labsâ€”a time range you're most likely to be available to attend live sessions. However, for any sessions you're not able to attend live, you'll still be able to catch recordings and participate on your own schedule.</p>
            <p>You will build upon your career artifacts, reflecting the new skills and experiences you acquired during Labs. The career artifact submission and review process will be similar to what you did during this unit.</p>
            <p>Finally, you will also start job search while in Labs, but you can get started now! Review job boards and if you find a job that is of interest to you, go ahead and apply!</p>
            
            <h3>What is Unique About Labs?</h3>
            <p>Labs is a hands-on experiential learning opportunity.</p>
            <p>Throughout your time in Labs, you will be working with your team on product features that are worth a certain number of points. These points are called story points. You'll also review pull requests (PRs) from other developers working on your product.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I pass Labs?</h3>
            <p>To pass Labs, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pass the Labs course</li>
                <li>Ship at least 21 story points. This means to have the code merged into the official code base</li>
                <li>Review at least 42 points of PRs from your product</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>More information on passing requirements will be provided once you enter Labs.</p>
            <p>You can complete Labs on your own schedule, but you must stay active and engaged by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submitting at least three standup updates per week</li>
                <li>Either submitting at least one commit on a pull request or reviewing at least two pull requests</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="highlight">You are now ready to enter the world of Labs!</p>
            
            <hr class="divider">
