            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We know you've worked hard to reach this milestone. Labs will be an exciting journey where you take your hard-earned knowledge and apply it to real-world environments.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-6 border-gray-200">
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-4">What to Expect in Labs</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Labs is an exciting hands-on experiential learning opportunity. Why does this matter to you?</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Well, for one, you'll be moving away from simply building projects for your portfolio to solving real-world complex and open-ended problems. With this new real-world experience, you'll be even better equipped to pitch your experience in interviews. By the time you graduate from Labs, you will have acquired new skills necessary to succeed on the job.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">One of the first tasks you will complete is the <strong>Labs Application</strong>. It is a brief survey that helps us place you on a team in Labs. As part of the Labs Application, you'll choose a time slot for your experience in Labsâ€”a time range you're most likely to be available to attend live sessions. However, for any sessions you're not able to attend live, you'll still be able to catch recordings and participate on your own schedule.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">You will build upon your career artifacts, reflecting the new skills and experiences you acquired during Labs. The career artifact submission and review process will be similar to what you did during this unit.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Finally, you will also start job search while in Labs, but you can get started now! Review job boards and if you find a job that is of interest to you, go ahead and apply!</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">What is Unique About Labs?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Labs is a hands-on experiential learning opportunity.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Throughout your time in Labs, you will be working with your team on product features that are worth a certain number of points. These points are called story points. You'll also review pull requests (PRs) from other developers working on your product.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">How do I pass Labs?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">To pass Labs, you must:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Pass the Labs course</li>
                <li>Ship at least 21 story points. This means to have the code merged into the official code base</li>
                <li>Review at least 42 points of PRs from your product</li>
            </ul>
