<p><span>In addition to completing your career artifacts, you must also complete your BloomTech Learner profile.</span></p>
<p>The BloomTech Learner profile is the one source of truth that our recruiting team use when presenting your information to hiring partners and potential employers. It contains essential information such as links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio, and Resume and information about your location, interests, skills, and project work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that you probably already have all the information needed in your career artifacts, so it is a matter of copy/pasting the information to your BloomTech Learner profile.</p>
