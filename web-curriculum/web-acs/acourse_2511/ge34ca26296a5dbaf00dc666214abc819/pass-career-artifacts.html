</head>
<body>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p><span>It is time to finalize your career artifacts and submit them!</span></p>
<p><span>During the core units, we provided you with the tools (core competency videos and practice activities) to help you build your career artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><strong>Instructions</strong></h4>
<p><span>Fill out the required fields on the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://forms.gle/UNnv1TDc8eUYkeXi8" target="_blank">Submit Your Career Artifact Links</a>&nbsp;form</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You will be prompted to provide:</span></li>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>GitHub URL</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>LinkedIn URL</span></li>

<span>Resume URL </span><strong>**must use the BloomTech resume template and </strong><strong>remember to set sharing permission to “anyone with the link” and grant editor access**</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What Happens Next</strong></h4>
<p><span>After you submit your career artifacts, a reviewer will provide written feedback. Please allow up to 3 business days to receive this feedback. Feedback will be in the form of an email and SMS text. Please pay close attention to your inbox during this time.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the feedback you receive, you have the opportunity to make the necessary changes to your career artifacts and resubmit using the form above (see Instructions).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move to the next unit, you must receive a passing grade in your career artifacts.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Grading and Rubrics</strong></h4>
