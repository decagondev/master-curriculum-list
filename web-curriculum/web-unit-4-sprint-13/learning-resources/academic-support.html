                <h2>Learner Assistant Unblocking Session</h2>
                <p>We offer <strong>academic support sessions</strong> with our Learner Assistants as a last resort when you have exhausted all other available resources. We are delighted to provide this service to you when you require it. It's important to note, however, that to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from this valuable resource, we limit learners to <strong>one (1) session per week</strong>. This allows us to serve as many learners as possible and ensures that our Learner Assistants have the time to devote to each session.</p>
                <p>While Learner Assistants are available to aid you in overcoming obstacles, they should not serve as a replacement for the instructor or live events. If you're unable to find a live event that suits your availability, please reach out by submitting a support ticket. We'll make every effort to accommodate your needs.</p>
