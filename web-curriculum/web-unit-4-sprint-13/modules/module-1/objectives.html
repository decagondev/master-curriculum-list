                <p>Traditionally, developers only used the JavaScript language in web browsers. But, in 2009, <strong>Node.js</strong> was unveiled, and with it, the developer tool kit expanded greatly. Node.js gave developers the chance to use JavaScript to write software that, up to that point, could only be written using C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and the like.</p>

                <p>We will use Node to write server code. Specifically, <strong>web services</strong> that communicate with clients using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for data interchange.</p>

                    <h3>Advantages of Node.js</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Node.js uses the same programming language (JavaScript) and paradigm for both client and server. Using the same language, we minimize context switching and share code between the client and the server.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is single-threaded, which removes the complexity involved in handling multiple threads.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is asynchronous, which allows us to take full advantage of the processor it's running on. Taking full advantage of the processor is crucial because the node process will be running on a single CPU.</li>
                        <li>Using JavaScript gives us access to the npm repository. This repository is the largest ecosystem of valuable libraries (most free to use) in <strong>npm modules.</strong></li>

                    <h3>Disadvantages of Node.js</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By strictly using JavaScript on the server, we cannot use the right tool (a particular language) for the job.</li>
                        <li>Because JavaScript is single-threaded, we can't take advantage of servers with multiple cores/processors.</li>
                        <li>Because JavaScript is asynchronous, it is harder to learn for developers that have only worked with languages that default to synchronous operations that block the execution thread.</li>
                        <li>In the npm repository, there are often too many packages that do the same thing. This excess of packages makes it harder to choose one and, in some cases, may introduce vulnerabilities into our code.</li>

                <h2>Follow Along</h2>
                <p>Using only Node.js, let's write a simple web server that returns a message. Create a folder for the server and add an <code>index.js</code> file inside.</p>

                <p>Next, add the following code to the <code>index.js</code> file:</p>

                <pre><code>const http = require("http"); // built in node.js module to handle http traffic

const hostname = "127.0.0.1"; // the local computer where the server is running
const port = 3000; // a port we'll use to watch for traffic

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // creates our server
    res.statusCode = 200; // http status code returned to the client
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain"); // inform the client that we'll be returning text
    res.end("Hello World from Node\n"); // end the request and send a response with the specified message
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    // start watching for connections on the port specified
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});</code></pre>

                <p>Now navigate to the folder in a terminal/console window and type: <code>node index.js</code> to execute your file. A message that reads "<em>Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000</em>" should be displayed, and the server is now waiting for connections.</p>

                <p>Open a browser and visit: <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. <code>localhost</code> and the IP address <code>127.0.0.1</code> point to the same thing: your local computer. The browser should show the message: "<em>Hello World from Node</em>". There you have it, your first web server, built from scratch using nothing but <code>Node.js</code>.</p>
