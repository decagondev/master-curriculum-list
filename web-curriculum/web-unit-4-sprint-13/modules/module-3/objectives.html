                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>There are different types of middleware; for our purposes, we'll group them into three different categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Built-in middleware</li>
                        <li>Third-party middleware</li>
                        <li>Custom middleware</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Built-in Middleware</h3>
                    <p><strong>Built-in middleware</strong> is included with Express but not added to the application automatically. Like the other types, we need to opt-in to using it in our application.</p>
                    <p>We saw an example of built-in middleware when we added support for parsing JSON content out of the request body using <code>server.use(express.json());</code>.</p>
                    <p>Every type of middleware works in the same way. We tell Express about the middleware we want to <em>turn on</em> for our application by making a call to <code>.use()</code> on our server and passing <code>.use()</code> the piece of middleware we want to apply.</p>

                    <h3>Third-party Middleware</h3>
                    <p><strong>Third-party middleware</strong> are npm modules that we can install and then import into our applications using <code>require()</code>. There are thousands of middleware modules we can use.</p>
                    <p>Some popular middleware modules are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan">morgan</a> - HTTP request logger middleware</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors</a> - Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet">helmet</a> - Helps secure Express apps with various HTTP headers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Custom Middleware</h3>
                    <p><strong>Custom middleware</strong> is functions we write to perform specific tasks. We'll learn more about how to write and use them in the next section.</p>

                    <h3>Follow Along</h3>
                    <p>One thing that is not immediately obvious is that <strong>route handlers are middleware</strong>. Let's see this in action.</p>
                    <p>Suppose a client visits a non-existent endpoint in our current implementation. In that case, they will get a default message when a resource is not found on the server. In the case of a browser, it's "Cannot Get /urlWeTriedToAccess." This default message makes for a poor user experience.</p>
                    <pre><code>server.use(function(req, res) {
  res.status(404).send("Ain't nobody got time for that!");
});</code></pre>
                    <p>Almost there! The last step is adding this status <strong>after each route handler</strong>. That way, if the preceding middleware or route handlers do not respond to the request, this will become our <em>catch-all</em> and respond with the correct HTTP status code and a helpful message.</p>

                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Write a paragraph (or two) explaining Express middleware and how you would use it when writing Web APIs.</p>

                <h2>Objective 2 - Write Custom Middleware</h2>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/zc6ucko8r6" title="Custom Middleware"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Writing <strong>custom middleware</strong> is a two-step process:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Write a function that will receive three or four arguments</li>
                        <li>Add it to the <em>middleware queue</em></li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Example: Request Logger</h3>
                    <p>Let's write middleware that logs information about every request that comes into our server:</p>
                    <pre><code>function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(
    `[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} to ${req.url} from ${req.get('Origin')}`
  );
  next();
}</code></pre>

                    <h3>Middleware Parameters</h3>
                    <p>A middleware function takes <strong>three parameters</strong>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>the <code>request</code> object</li>
                        <li>the <code>response</code> object</li>
                        <li>a <code>function that points to the next middleware</code> in the queue</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>By convention, we name the third parameter <code>next</code>. Please stick to that convention in your code.</p>

                    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any middleware in the queue CAN modify both the request and response objects, but it's NOT required</li>
                        <li>Any middleware in the queue can stop the request and send a response back to the client</li>
                        <li>Calling the <code>next()</code> function signals to Express that the middleware has finished</li>
                        <li>If <code>next()</code> is not called and a response is not sent back to the client, the request will hang</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Follow Along</h3>
                    <p>Let's see middleware in action by writing our very own authentication middleware. We'll create a simple example that only grants access to a specific route.</p>
                    <pre><code>function auth(req, res, next) {
  if (req.url === '/mellon') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.send('You shall not pass!');
  }
}</code></pre>

                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Write a piece of middleware that responds with the message, "Balance is the key; making things even is the secret to success." In addition, it should send an HTTP Status Code 403 (Forbidden) when the client sends a request when the seconds' value in the server clock is odd. Otherwise, let the request flow through the rest of the middleware queue.</p>
                    <p>For example, if a client makes any request and the server clock is at 11:10:11 or 11:10:13, the request is rejected. But, at 11:10:12 or 11:10:14, the request is accepted and handled.</p>
