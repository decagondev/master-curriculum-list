<h3>Important Note About Heroku</h3>
<p>This Guided Project explains how to make an Express application deployable to Heroku, and then demonstrates the deployment process itself. Heroku is the most pragmatic service for deploying a full-stack personal project for potential employers to see. However, <strong>as of November 2022 Heroku does not provide a totally free tier</strong> like they used to, so we do not expect you to use their services during this Guided Project. We only need you to understand how to make an API deployable to Heroku or similar providers.</p>

<h3><strong>Resources</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The recording shows how to create a project from scratch, but you can use the following starter repo:</strong></p>
<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/node-api4-guided" target="_blank"><strong>Web Deployment and Best Practices</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Solution repo:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/node-api4-guided-solution" target="_blank">Web Deployment and Best Practices Solution</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3>
<p>The versions of project dependencies used in the recording are slightly different from the ones used in the starter and solution repositories, but this should not affect the relevant code of the Guided Project.</p>
<p>The versions used in the repositories are more recent, and thus more similar to the versions you will install if you create a project from scratch.</p>
