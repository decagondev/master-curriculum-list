<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><code>REST</code> is a generally agreed-upon set of principles and constraints. They are <strong>recommendations</strong>, not a standard.</p>
<p><span>When designing a RESTful Web API, keep the following principles in mind:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>Everything is a<strong> resource.</strong></span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>Each resource is accessible via a<strong> unique URI.</strong></span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>Resources can have multiple <strong>representations.</strong></span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>Communication happens over a <strong>stateless</strong> protocol (HTTP).</span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>Resource management happens via <strong>HTTP methods.</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the <code>REST</code> architecture to our APIs can make them scalable and simpler to maintain and extend.</p>
<h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
<p>REST APIs have six constraints:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>client-server</strong> architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>stateless</strong> architecture: each request should stand on its own, and order should not matter. No shared state.</li>
    <li><strong>cacheable</strong>: improves network performance.
        <ul>
            <li><code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> should be <em>idempotent</em> (the same command executed multiple times, the state of resources on the server is exactly the same, much like pure functions)</li>
            <li><code>POST</code> is <em>not</em> idempotent.</li>
            <li>Caching is a way to store and retrieve data so that the server can fulfill future requests faster without repeating expensive calculations or operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>layered system</strong>: component A (a client) might or might not communicate directly with component B (the server). There may be other layers between them like logging, caching, DNS servers, load balancers, and authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>code on demand</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The API returns the resource and code to act on it.</li>
            <li>The client only needs to know how to execute the code.</li>
            <li>Makes the API more flexible, upgradeable, and extendible.</li>
            <li>Most web applications send JavaScript code along with the data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>uniform interfaces</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Each resource should be accessible through a single URL. Not a hard requirement, but recommended.</li>
            <li>We should be able to manage the resources through these <em>representations</em> (the URL).</li>
            <li>every interaction with the resource should happen through the URL identifier we gave to it.</li>
            <li>Self-descriptive messages.</li>
            <li><strong>HATEOAS</strong> (<strong>H</strong>ypermedia <strong>A</strong>s <strong>T</strong>he <strong>E</strong>ngine <strong>O</strong>f <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>S</strong>tate). Much like a <em>choose your own adventure book</em>, the pages are not read in order. You start on page 1. Based on the information available, the reader (client) chooses the action to take, moving them to a different page. A good example of a hypermedia API is <a href="https://api.github.com">the GitHub API</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
