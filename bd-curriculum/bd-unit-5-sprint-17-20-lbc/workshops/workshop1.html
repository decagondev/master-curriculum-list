                    <h3>Workshop Objective</h3>
                    <p>In this workshop, you will be grouped with others to brainstorm potential project ideas. These groups are intended only for this exercise, but if you'd like to team up with people afterward, you are encouraged to do so (no more than 4 per team).</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">What is a Workshop?</h2>
                <p>Workshops (like Code-Alongs) are live sessions 50 minutes in length designed to offer feedback and insights into your work and are offered seven days a week in the morning, afternoon, and evening.</p>
                
                <p>Because Workshops focus on building on what you already have, you will need to come to class prepared to have the best experience.</p>
                
                <h2 class="section-title">Workshop Process</h2>
                <p>Below is the brainstorming process we will use in the workshop. We're forcing you to select something very quickly, we know. Remember that the goal is to Learn; the project idea isn't what anyone is judging.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>(5 min)</strong> Creativity warm-up: free word association. First person says, "Sunset", and rotate through the team members, each saying one word, the first that comes to mind after the previous word. Go around 4 times. Don't write anything down.</li>
                    <li><strong>(5 min)</strong> Put phones away, mute laptops, turn off the zoom video. 5 minutes no noise, not talking, write down as many additional ideas as you can think of in 5 minutes. Try to have one that is really out there and crazy.</li>
                    <li><strong>(5 min)</strong> Each person will read their list of ideas, then paste into one shared document.</li>
                    <li><strong>(15 min)</strong> Now try to brainstorm as a group to 99 items total. Your most creative ideas might come after you think you've already reached the limit of ideas you can come up with. Say them out loud and add them to the shared document as you go. Try not to clobber one another, but continue throwing out ideas and capturing them.</li>
                    <li><strong>(5 min)</strong> Vote on the ideas: each person gets 3 votes, and should put their alias next to the ideas they vote for. Eliminate any ideas with zero votes. If multiple people select the same item, you can team up with those people to make a team (no more than four per team).</li>
                    <li>Each person can now narrow their choices to one idea that they will work on.</li>
                    <li>Schedule time to write up/review/revise/close on the Problem Statement.</li>
                    <li><strong>(5 min)</strong> Come up with a project name. Note that this will also be used to form part of your project's url.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2 class="section-title">Preparation Checklist</h2>
                <p>You will not need to prepare anything specific before this workshop, but it's helpful to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have a general idea of the type of project you might be interested in</li>
                    <li>Be familiar with the module content from Module 1</li>
                    <li>Come with an open mind and be ready to collaborate</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Next Steps After the Workshop</h3>
                    <p>After the workshop, you should:</p>
                    <ol>

                        <li>Form a team if you wish to collaborate (maximum 4 people)</li>
                        <li>Begin drafting the problem statement section of your design document</li>
