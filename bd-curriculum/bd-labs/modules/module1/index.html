                <h2>How Labs Works</h2>
                <p>The goal of Labs is to help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply and integrate skills taught in core on a complex project.</li>
                    <li>Articulate code contributions confidently in a technical interview.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To achieve this, we will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Present you with a project template. This template will give you starter code for you to build
                        off of. You will fork this GitHub template, locally setup the repo on your computer, and begin
                        work on tickets we've made for you.</li>
                    <li>Give you tickets to add components/features to the existing project. Similar to what a junior
                        dev might do, you will add working code to the complex project and deliver the requirements of
                        each ticket.</li>
                    <li>Have you submit your code alongside a Loom video explaining what you did and why you did it.
                        Each build sprint will require the submission of 2 deliverables: loom video link and GitHub code
                        link. The code is meant to test your technical ability, and the loom video is meant to simulate
                        a technical interview.</li>
                    <li>Grade your deliverables based on the rubric attached to each sprint submission. The rubric will
                        measure if you are ready for your first dev job based on your ability to code and how well you
                        articulate what you did.</li>
                    <li>Check your resume for your Labs' contributions. We want to make sure that you added the complex
                        project you worked on to your resume to showcase your ability as an developer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To give this plan structure, we have divided these goals into 5 modules:</p>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Labs Tech Stack</h2>
                <p>Before diving into the Labs environment, it's important to understand the technology stack that
                    powers it. In software development, a technology stack refers to the combination of tools,
                    frameworks, and languages used to build a product.</p>

                <p>The following is a list of the key components in the Labs Tech Stack:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> SpringBoot + Java - easy to create stand-alone, production-grade
                        Spring based Applications that you can "just run"</li>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL - an open-source relational database management system
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By being familiar with these technologies, you'll be better equipped to complete Labs modules and
                    build your coding skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>Labs Best Practices & Tips for Success</h2>
                <p>Ok—now you know how Labs works and the goal of Labs. But what does success in Labs look like—and how
                    do you achieve it?</p>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>Get ready to hear this over and over from here on out: communication is the key to producing great
                    software. If your mind goes blank in an interview and there's only one word you can remember, make
                    sure it's "communication."</p>

                <p>Communication comes in many forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll need to communicate with your Product Manager about the scope, objectives, and priorities
                        of your product.</li>
                    <li>You'll need to communicate with your Engineering and Data Science Managers for guidance on
                        implementation and to resolve issues (after first troubleshooting with your team!).</li>
                    <li>You'll need to communicate with future developers on your product by including solid
                        documentation.</li>
                    <li>You'll need to communicate with future employers so they grasp your ability and experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Do all of these throughout Labs and beyond, and you will succeed in Labs and at your first job.</p>

                <h3>Professionalism</h3>
                <p>In virtually every way, Labs is designed both to equip you to land a job and to prepare you for the
                    job itself. (What use would it be to be able to get a job, but not keep it?)</p>

                <p>Professionalism factors into both of these critical goals. Ask yourself: what does professionalism
                    mean to you?</p>

                <p>Many factors contribute to professionalism in the job search and in the workplace, but here are some
                    of the big things to focus on in Labs to prepare you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show up:</strong> Be here, whether live or by submitting regular updates and
                        communicating frequently with your team. Treat Labs like a job. Don't leave your teammates
                        hanging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cameras on:</strong> Have you ever spoken to a Zoom room full of faceless squares? Your
                        instructors have 😞 But you know what? We can take it! A hiring manager, on the other hand... In
                        Labs, you'll need to keep your camera on to practice the level of interaction a hiring manager
                        will expect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Participate:</strong> Speak up during meetings, ask and respond to questions, commit
                        code every day, and engage critically with your project and the curriculum. This will help by
                        getting you in the habit of doing the same kinds of things on the job.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The 3 Ps</h3>
                <p>The 3 Ps (Prepared, Positive, Progress) and Professionalism are key to success in Labs. By being
                    prepared and positive, you can communicate your progress effectively and professionally. Make sure
                    to focus on these key elements to ensure that your meetings are productive and successful.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be Prepared</li>
                    <li>Be Positive</li>
                    <li>Communicate Progress</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As with everything in Labs, be sure to focus on professionalism in meetings as well—have your camera
                    on, don't interrupt—but most importantly, participate. (Hm—maybe there should be four Ps... 🧐)</p>

                <h3>Failure</h3>
                <h4>Embrace Failure for Growth</h4>
                <p>In Labs, you will face challenges and obstacles. This is a normal part of the learning process, and
                    it's essential for your growth as a professional. In fact, failure is an opportunity to learn,
                    expand your skills, and level up.</p>

                <p>Remember, failure is not a setback. It's a chance to gain experience, practice, and develop new
                    strategies. Throughout your career, you will face failures repeatedly, and this is a good thing. The
                    more you fail, the more you grow.</p>

                <p>So, be open to failure, embrace it, and use it to your advantage. Work with others to overcome
                    obstacles and learn from each other. Utilize all available resources, including failure, to become a
                    better and more skilled professional.</p>

                <p>We're thrilled to have you with us in Labs, and we look forward to working, failing, and learning
                    together with you 🙂</p>

                <h2>Getting Support</h2>
                <p>In Labs, you'll have a fleet of staff, instructors, learner assistants, and career reviewers to
                    support you. Here's how to get help.</p>

                <h3>The 20-Minute Rule</h3>
                <p>For technical problems, follow the 20-minute rule:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>First, try to solve the problem on your own for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If still unsolved, loop in a teammate for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If still unsolved, loop in your team's Learning Assistant for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If still unsolved, post in the Labs Slack channel.</li>
                    <li>If still unsolved, post in the Hub Knowledge Base for support from your community of peers and
                        instructors!</li>
                    <li>If still unsolved, open a support ticket in the Hub for help from a Learning Assistant.</li>

                <h2>User Stories</h2>
                <h3>What are User Stories?</h3>

                <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe class="wistia_embed" title="User Stories Video"
                        src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/2kkp4zwlo4?seo=false" width="640" height="379"
                        name="wistia_embed" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
                </div>

                <p>A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal expressed from the
                    user's perspective.</p>

                <p>The user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective
                    of the end-user or stakeholder. Note that it's not a feature itself!</p>

                <p>The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back
                    to the stakeholder. Note that "stakeholders" don't have to be external end-users in the traditional
                    sense. They can also be internal stakeholders or colleagues within your organization who depend on
                    your team. A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in the development of a product.</p>

                <p>User stories are a sentence or two in simple language that outline the desired outcome. They don't go
                    into detail. Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.</p>

                <h3>User Story Formats</h3>
                <p>As a (who wants to accomplish something)</p>
                <p>I want to (what they want to accomplish)</p>
                <p>So that (why/rationale on what the user wants to accomplish)</p>
                <p>Example: As a user, I want to log in using a username and password so that the system can
                    authenticate my login.</p>

                <h3>User Stories and Agile Development</h3>
                <p>Stories fit neatly into agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. Agile is a development methodology
                    that focuses on responsiveness to change—keeping the development process lean and focusing on
                    keeping everybody aligned. You keep development cycles short, so you can get a minimum viable
                    product (MVP) up and running quickly, and then iterate (repeat) during the next cycle based on what
                    you learn from it. In Labs, we'll use an agile workflow that you'll be able to translate into a wide
                    variety of work environments in the industry.</p>

                <p>In Agile, user stories are added to sprints and "burned down" throughout the sprint. Kanban teams
                    pull user stories into their backlog and run them through their workflow. Jira Software features a
                    form of Kanban to help your team manage their user stories and tasks. Thanks to stories, Kanban
                    teams learn how to manage work-in-progress (WIP) and refine their workflows.</p>

                <p>Learn about project planning techniques specific to Labs and how to structure your work.</p>

                <h3>Kanban</h3>
                <p>Kanban is a methodology that comes from Japanese manufacturing practices developed in the mid-20th
                    century. Factories would use written cards handed from person to person to communicate the status of
                    operations. These cards were a "lean" way to manage the creation of products that was highly
                    responsive to the realities on the ground.</p>

                <p>In the same way as efficiently manufacturing cars, agile software development requires responsiveness
                    to changing realities. Microsoft began developing an approach (that was soon iterated by many) to
                    track progress on a "Kanban board"—a set of columns containing cards representing bits of work. The
                    development team would move the cards along the board to different columns to represent their
                    status.</p>

                <img src="../../assets/kanban.png"
                    alt="Kanban board with Backlog, In Progress, Ready for Review, and Done columns." loading="lazy">

                <p>Kanban board with Backlog, In Progress, Ready for Review, and Done columns.</p>

                <p>Accordingly, Kanban comes from the Japanese language meaning "Visual Board" used in JIT ("just in
                    time") development. Kanban is growing and it continues to evolve over time.</p>

                <p>Kanban opens the door for communication to the entire team. The biggest advantages to using Kanban
                    are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Enable evolutionary change</li>
                    <li>Implement and scale in an agile way</li>
                    <li>Establish culture and best practices</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In order for Kanban to be successful, the organization and team have to be educated on how Kanban
                    works. While the process seems simple, Kanban needs consistent grooming. It's a powerful tool, but
                    it is only as good as the team that uses it. It's important to discuss the board and move tasks as
                    they progress over time!</p>

                <h4>Kanban Concepts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A card represents a unit of work</li>
                    <li>Work will flow in single units or small batches</li>
                    <li>Limit work in progress (WIP)</li>
                    <li>Monitor the cards that go into the in-progress lane</li>
                    <li>The number of Kanban cards equates to project work known as units</li>
                    <li>The project manager (PM) uses this to determine capacity for the team</li>
                    <li>Each card gives the PM a view of who is assigned</li>
                    <li>Only in-progress items should be in the in-progress column</li>
                    <li>New work can only start when space is available</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Kanban Goals</h4>
                <p>The team needs to agree on a set of goals as the cards are set. The cards should consist of the
                    feature or products the stakeholder wants.</p>

                <p>As a team, each feature needs to be broken down into a user story—this will help the team understand
                    the goal the customer wants to achieve.</p>

                <p>Identifying the user stories (and stakeholder's goals):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides transparency</li>
                    <li>Enables higher quality</li>
                    <li>Simplifies priority sorting</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Breaking down user stories into tasks and then assigning those tasks (task management):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eliminates confusion</li>
                    <li>Sets a clear path to completion</li>
                    <li>Provides clarity on who is working on what</li>
                    <li>Gives visibility to the team's "velocity" (work completed over time)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tasks</h3>
                <p>A task is a granular unit of work that needs to get done to ship a user story.</p>

                <p>In the industry, Technical Project Managers are responsible for prioritizing the backlog and
                    capturing requirements from the business and the users for that sprint—but the developers are really
                    the ones best positioned to understand what in terms of technical capabilities must be developed, as
                    well as the level of effort that will entail.</p>

                <h4>Tips for Tasks</h4>
                <p>There are a few important things to consider when breaking down user stories into tasks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Keep tasks small, but not too small. As a rule of thumb, a task should be something that can be
                        done within a single day, but not in a few minutes' time either.</li>
                    <li>Keep tasks very precise in scope. Don't create tasks with such vague statements as "Coding" or
                        "Implementation" thinking that anyone can just refer to the parent user story for details. Write
                        something more meaningful that also makes the scope very clear. For example: "Develop the login
                        class."</li>
                    <li>Use the user story's acceptance criteria as a starting point, and its definition of done as a
                        checklist. The acceptance criteria will help you determine what features need to be implemented,
                        and the definition of done is a checklist for all user stories that can also help you determine
                        if you're missing any tasks for the story to be done.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>User Flows and Wireframes</h4>
                <p>Designers frequently use lean artifacts like user flows and wireframes to think about and communicate
                    how users will interact with an application.</p>

                <h3>User Flows</h3>
                <p>A user flow is a diagram that shows how a user moves through an application to achieve a goal.</p>

                <h3>Styles</h3>
                <p>Styles are anything that affects the feel or personality of an application. Styles can generally be
                    boiled down to shape, color, and type.</p>
