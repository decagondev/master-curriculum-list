        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Memory Management in Java</h2>
            <p>Understanding how memory works in Java is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. In this module, we'll explore Java's memory model and how it affects your application's performance and behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>The Java Memory Model</h3>
            <p>Java's memory is divided into two main regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Where local variables and method call information are stored</li>
                <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Where objects and their instance variables are stored</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Stack</h3>
            <p>The stack is a region of memory that stores:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Method calls (stack frames)</li>
                <li>Local primitive variables</li>
                <li>References to objects in the heap</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each thread in a Java application has its own stack. When a method is called, a new frame is created on the stack, containing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The method's parameters</li>
                <li>Local variables</li>
                <li>Return address (where execution should continue after the method completes)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When a method completes, its frame is removed from the stack.</p>
            
            <h3>The Heap</h3>
            <p>The heap is a shared region of memory where all objects are allocated. When you create an object using <code>new</code>, memory is allocated on the heap. The heap contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects (instances of classes)</li>
                <li>Instance variables (including primitives and references to other objects)</li>
                <li>Arrays (even of primitive types)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The heap is managed by the garbage collector, which automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer reachable.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Garbage Collection</h2>
            <p>Java's garbage collector automatically identifies and removes objects that are no longer reachable from your application. This helps prevent memory leaks and makes memory management easier.</p>
            
            <h3>How Garbage Collection Works</h3>
            <p>An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it's no longer reachable through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>References from the stack</li>
                <li>References from other live objects in the heap</li>
                <li>References from JNI (Java Native Interface) methods</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The garbage collector periodically runs to identify and remove unreachable objects, freeing up memory for new allocations.</p>
            
            <h3>Memory Leak Prevention</h3>
            <p>Even with garbage collection, memory leaks can still occur if you maintain references to objects you no longer need. Common causes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing objects in static fields</li>
                <li>Adding objects to collections (like lists or maps) but never removing them</li>
                <li>Implementing listeners or callbacks without proper cleanup</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To prevent memory leaks, always remove references to objects you no longer need, especially in long-lived containers or when using event listeners.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction to Scrum</h2>
            <p>Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams work together. Like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.</p>
            
            <p>While Scrum is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Scrum Works</h3>
            <p>Scrum is popular for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Everyone knows what's happening and why</li>
                <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: The team regularly checks on progress and adjusts</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: Plans and processes can change as needed</li>
                <li><strong>Incremental Delivery</strong>: Value is delivered frequently in small chunks</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Scrum Framework Components</h2>
            
            <h3>Scrum Roles</h3>
            <p>There are three main roles in Scrum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Represents the stakeholders and customers, defines requirements</li>
                <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Ensures the team follows Scrum practices, removes impediments</li>
                <li><strong>Development Team</strong>: Cross-functional members who do the actual work</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scrum Events</h3>
            <p>Scrum defines several time-boxed events (meetings) that create regularity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sprint</strong>: A time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) where work is completed</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Planning</strong>: Team decides what to work on in the upcoming sprint</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Standup</strong>: Brief daily meeting to sync the team (15 minutes)</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Review</strong>: Team demonstrates what was accomplished during the sprint</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>: Team reflects on the sprint and plans improvements</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scrum Artifacts</h3>
            <p>Scrum uses several tools to make work visible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: Prioritized list of all desired features and fixes</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: Items selected for the current sprint</li>
                <li><strong>Increment</strong>: The sum of all completed items at the end of a sprint</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">User Stories</h2>
            <p>User stories are a way of describing features from an end-user perspective. They typically follow this format:</p>
            
            <p><em>As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].</em></p>
            
            <p>For example: "As a customer, I want to be able to save items to a wishlist so that I can easily find them later."</p>
            
            <p>User stories help the team focus on delivering value to users rather than implementing features for their own sake. They're written in everyday language, which makes them accessible to everyone involved in the project.</p>
            
            <h3>INVEST Criteria for Good User Stories</h3>
            <p>A good user story should be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Independent</strong>: Can be developed separately from other stories</li>
                <li><strong>Negotiable</strong>: Details can be discussed and refined</li>
                <li><strong>Valuable</strong>: Delivers value to a stakeholder</li>
                <li><strong>Estimable</strong>: Team can estimate the effort required</li>
                <li><strong>Small</strong>: Can be completed within a sprint</li>
                <li><strong>Testable</strong>: Clear criteria for when it's done</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Using Trello for Scrum</h2>
            <p>Trello is a popular tool for implementing Scrum because of its flexibility and visual nature. Here's how to set up a basic Scrum board in Trello:</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Board Structure</h3>
            <p>A typical Scrum board in Trello might have these lists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backlog</strong>: All user stories that haven't been planned yet</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: User stories selected for the current sprint</li>
                <li><strong>In Progress</strong>: Stories currently being worked on</li>
                <li><strong>Review/QA</strong>: Stories completed but awaiting review</li>
                <li><strong>Done</strong>: Stories that are completed and meet the definition of done</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Creating Cards</h3>
            <p>Each card in Trello represents a user story or task. A well-structured card should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clear title (often the user story)</li>
                <li>A detailed description</li>
                <li>Acceptance criteria</li>
                <li>Story points or effort estimate</li>
                <li>Labels for categorization</li>
                <li>Assigned team members</li>
                <li>Due dates if applicable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Managing the Sprint</h3>
            <p>During the sprint, team members move cards from left to right as work progresses. This provides visibility into the state of the sprint and helps identify bottlenecks or blockers.</p>
